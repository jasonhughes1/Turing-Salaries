## Overview
Turing-Salaries was a two week project partnered capstone project. We took data from people who submitted information about their first job out of the Turing School Software and Design, and did data visualizations on the aggregrated data. We used HighCharts library for the first time, which was great library for interactive data visualizations.

## Area of Focus
The main area of focus for this application was that it was a full stack application with a Node, Express, and Knex back-end. While using React, Redux, and Router on the front-end. The data visualization was with a charting library called HighCharts.
